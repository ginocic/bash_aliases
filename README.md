# Installation
## Step 1
```bash
cd
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ginocic/bash_aliases/main/.bash_aliases
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ginocic/bash_aliases/main/.bash_secret
```

## Step 2
Test your work. Do **NOT** log-out of your existing terminal session. Instead, open a new terminal session.

Worst case is that you will be unable to login to the new terminal session. This is why you should never log-out of an existing terminal session until you are 100% certain that changes made to either .bashrc or .profile are working. If you can't launch a new session, you just use the existing session to track down and nail any bugs. Rinse, repeat.
